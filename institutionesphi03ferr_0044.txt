requiritur nempe visibilis astriom‘las, quae valeat eos repri-
mere et metu poenarum constringere ad inita pacta ob-
servanda (1). En itaque ad naturae nostrae pravitatem re-
medium: remedium est sortis coercitio despoticae civilis
potestatis.

a) Quod si quaeras de modo talem erigendi potesta-
tem, 110111165 sic respondet (2) Modus unicus talem erigendi
communem potestatem, quae valeat ab occupationibus alie-
nigenarum et a mutuis iniuriis eos defendere, eaque ratione

 

(1) Cap. XVII. « Agreement of men is by covenant only, which
is artificial: and therefore it is no wonder if there be somewhat else
required (besides covenant) to make their agreement constant and
lasting: which is a common power to keep them in awo, and to
direct their actions to the common benefit. »

(2) lbid. <c The only way to erect such a common power, as
may be able to defend them from the invasion of foreigners and
the iniuries of one another, and 11161611)ν 10 secure them in such
sort, as that by their own industry and by the fruits of the earth,
they may nourish themselves and live contentedly‚ is, to confer all
their power and strength upon one man or upon one assembly of
men, 111111 may reduce all their wills, by plurality of voices, unto
one will: which is as much as to say, to appoint one man or as-
sembly of men, to bear their person3 and every one to own and .
to :le-knowledge himself to be the author of whatsoever he that so ⁷
bears their person, shall act or cause to be acted, in those things
which concern the common peace and satety3 and therein to submit
their wills, every one to his will, and their judgement to his jud-
gement. This is more than consent or concord: it is :1 real unity of
them all in one and the same person, made by covenant os every
man with every man, in such manner, as if every man should say
to every man, I authorise and give up my right of governing my-
sels, to this man or to this asscmhly of mem, on this condition, that
thou give up thy right lo him, am] authorise all his actions in lisca
manner. This done, the multitude 50 united in one person, is called
a conmzonwsallh, in latin civitas. This is the gener-&tion of that great
Levialhcm, or rather (to speak more reverently) of that 111011111 God,
to which we owe under the immortal God our peace and defence. ³)
